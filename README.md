# Generative AI and Linked Data
A detailed record of the research performed during my summer 2023 internship with AFRL. Everything here is declassed, so it is ok to host this publicly. A project was developed and presented by the end of the summer, but the general focus of research (very open-ended) was:

1. Getting generative models to spit out valid triples and maybe DL axioms
2. ML workflows, from end-to-end, in an operational military context of training, testing, deploying and replacing in the field

This repo reflects that research, organizing it as appropriate.

# Survey
On the interplay between Linked Data constructs and LLMs, Tim has included me on a paper of his that surveys this exact topic. He extracted 5 key sub-topics of research:
* Knowledge Graph Generation
* Knowledge Graph Completion
* Knowledge Graph Enrichment
* Ontology Alignment
* Language Model Probing

It is in the publication pipeline and stuck on [Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a7FqwuyXS3frXY6m10sysSjMtKm_l4NRT55nyJw4nkzI1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=ba2b05c7-541b-4166-93dd-a25d355f20e7&tenantId=6931c963-07b7-4156-ab0e-35d1f79035b8). Any paper cited here is out of the scope of Tim's paper, or else it was missed.
