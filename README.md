# Generative AI and Linked Data

# Survey
On the interplay between Linked Data constructs and ML, Tim has included me on a paper of his that surveys this exact topic. He extracted 5 key sub-topics of research:
* Knowledge Graph Generation
* Knowledge Graph Completion
* Knowledge Graph Enrichment
* Ontology Alignment
* Language Model Probing

It is in the publication pipeline and stuck on [Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a7FqwuyXS3frXY6m10sysSjMtKm_l4NRT55nyJw4nkzI1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=ba2b05c7-541b-4166-93dd-a25d355f20e7&tenantId=6931c963-07b7-4156-ab0e-35d1f79035b8).
